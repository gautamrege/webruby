Preparing the Core Ruby participants for the web

RubyLearning.org is planning a free, online course on topics that hopefully will help those that have some knowledge of Ruby programming to get started with web programming - call it "Intermediate Ruby Programming". This does not cover Ruby on Rails. 

The course material is under preparation and I am looking for help from you to help create - add / subtract / modify the topics and material for this course. We also require many problems/solutions for the course participants.

The course is scheduled for 7th Jan. 2012 and we would have 3-4 mentors helping out the participants during the course. 

Can you help?


Update (21st Nov 2011):

b. Michael Kohl ( https://github.com/citizen428 ) for proof reading and making relevant corrections to chapters 1 and 2.
